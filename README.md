# Cryptanalysis
This repo contains code where I have rolled my own crypto in an attempt to learn more about cryptologic design and cryptanalysis. These ciphers are not to be used in any way except for learning purposes and should not be used on production systems.

# Ciphers

RAF-1 (Random As F\*ck-1) is a Substitution-Permutation Network cipher. See the project README for more info.
